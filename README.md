# ts-server

You find here a backend starter using NodeJS, expressJS, mongoDB and all this using TypeScript.

In this starter project i want to benifit from TypeScript advantags in order to use OOP concept and a good separation of concerns.

To create another component or module, and since im an Angular lover i tried to make it as simple as i can, so you can use **npm run c _nameOfYourComponent_** and this will create a controller, route and model schema for mongoose.

## How to run the project ?

1. Clone the project using git clone
2. run npm install
3. Enjoy your coding
